# make_eclipse
Makefile templates with a target to build Eclipse projects

This is very much a work in progress, that has been copied from a (working) personal
project, but copying of directories has not been done to preserve proper relative
directory structure.  However, the basics are there to build an Eclipse Neon CDT
project using 'make eclipse' if you are patient and work through any broken links.

This project may be updated in the future as improvements are made, but the primary
purpose of making it public is to avoid any potential IP conflicts when the contents
are imported into a separate professional project.
